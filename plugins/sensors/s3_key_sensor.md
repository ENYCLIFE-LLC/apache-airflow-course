## S3KeySensor

The `S3KeySensor` in Apache Airflow is designed to wait for a specific file or key to appear in an S3 bucket. It works by repeatedly checking the S3 bucket for the presence of the specified key. When the key is found, the sensor task completes, and downstream tasks can proceed.

### How `S3KeySensor` Works

- **Polling**: The sensor polls the S3 bucket at a specified interval (`poke_interval`) to check for the existence of the specified key.
- **Timeout**: If the key is not found within a specified timeout period (`timeout`), the sensor task fails.

### Triggering `S3KeySensor` Without `TriggerDagRunOperator`

If you want to trigger the second DAG to use `S3KeySensor` based on a file upload event, you can use event-driven architectures. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **ExternalTrigger with Lambda and CloudWatch**:
    - Use an AWS Lambda function to trigger the second DAG when a new file is uploaded to S3.
    - Set up an S3 event notification to trigger the Lambda function.
    - The Lambda function calls the Airflow REST API to trigger the DAG.

2. **Schedule Interval with Short Intervals**:
    - Schedule the second DAG to run at frequent intervals (e.g., every minute).
    - Within the DAG, use `S3KeySensor` to check for the presence of the file.
    - If the file is not present, the sensor will wait until it appears or times out.

### Example: Using AWS Lambda to Trigger the Second DAG

Here is a detailed approach using an AWS Lambda function to trigger the second DAG:

#### Step 1: Create the Lambda Function

1. **Lambda Function Code**:
    - The Lambda function will call the Airflow REST API to trigger the second DAG.

```python
import json
import boto3
import requests

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Airflow configuration
    AIRFLOW_URL = "http://your-airflow-webserver/api/v1/dags/process_uploaded_file_dag/dagRuns"
    AIRFLOW_USERNAME = "your_airflow_username"
    AIRFLOW_PASSWORD = "your_airflow_password"
    
    # Extract bucket name and object key from the event
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Create a session using Boto3
    session = boto3.Session()
    
    # Trigger the Airflow DAG
    response = requests.post(
        AIRFLOW_URL,
        auth=(AIRFLOW_USERNAME, AIRFLOW_PASSWORD),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        data=json.dumps({"conf": {"bucket_name": bucket_name, "object_key": object_key}})
    )
    
    return {
        'statusCode': response.status_code,
        'body': response.text
    }
```

2. **Create the Lambda Function**:
    - Go to the AWS Lambda console and create a new function.
    - Choose a runtime (e.g., Python 3.x).
    - Copy and paste the above code into the function code editor.

3. **Set up S3 Event Notification**:
    - Go to the S3 console and select the bucket where the file will be uploaded.
    - Go to the "Properties" tab and find the "Event notifications" section.
    - Add a new event notification to trigger the Lambda function on the `s3:ObjectCreated:*` event.

#### Step 2: Modify the Second DAG to Use the Provided Configuration

Modify the second DAG to read the S3 bucket name and object key from the DAG configuration:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.s3_key import S3KeySensor
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from datetime import timedelta

# Default arguments for the DAG
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    'process_uploaded_file_dag',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='A DAG to detect the uploaded file in S3 and process it',
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    catchup=False,
)

# Extract S3 bucket name and object key from DAG run configuration
bucket_name = "{{ dag_run.conf['bucket_name'] }}"
object_key = "{{ dag_run.conf['object_key'] }}"

# S3KeySensor task
s3_key_sensor_task = S3KeySensor(
    task_id='s3_key_sensor_task',
    bucket_name=bucket_name,
    bucket_key=object_key,
    aws_conn_id='aws_default',
    poke_interval=60,  # Check every 60 seconds
    timeout=3600,      # Timeout after 1 hour
    dag=dag,
)

# Dummy task to represent further processing
def process_file(**kwargs):
    filename = object_key
    print(f'Processing file: {filename}')
    # Add further processing logic here

process_file_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='process_file_task',
    python_callable=process_file,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

# Define task dependencies
s3_key_sensor_task >> process_file_task
```

### Explanation:

1. **Lambda Function**:
    - The Lambda function is triggered by an S3 event notification when a new file is uploaded.
    - It calls the Airflow REST API to trigger the second DAG with the S3 bucket name and object key as configuration parameters.

2. **Second DAG**:
    - The second DAG reads the S3 bucket name and object key from the DAG run configuration.
    - It uses the `S3KeySensor` to wait for the presence of the specified object key in the S3 bucket.
    - Once the file is detected, the DAG continues to process the file.

This approach ensures that the second DAG is triggered in response to the S3 file upload event and uses `S3KeySensor` to detect and process the uploaded file.
